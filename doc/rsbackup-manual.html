    <h2><a name=overview>1. Overview</a></h2>

    <div>

      <p><code>rsbackup</code> backs up your computer(s) to removable
      hard disks.  The backup is an ordinary filesystem tree, and hard
      links between repeated backups are used to save space.  Old
      backups are automatically <i>pruned</i> after a set period of
      time.</p>

      <p>This guide describes how to set up and manage
      <code>rsbackup</code>.  See <a href="rsbackup.1.html">the man
      page</a> for detailed reference information.</p>

    </div>

    <h2><a name=setup>2. Setting Up</a></h2>

    <div>

      <h3><a name=install>2.1 Installation</a></h3>

      <div>

        <p>The systems you want to back up are called <i>clients</i>.
        The system that has the backup hard disk(s) attached to it is
        called the <i>server</i>, and it is on this system that the
        <code>rsbackup</code> program runs.  The server can itself be a
        client.</p>

        <p>Each client must have an SSH server and rsync installed.
        For Debian and Ubuntu systems it should be sufficient to
        install them as follows (if you don’t have them already):</p>

        <pre class=example>apt-get install openssh-server rsync</pre>

        <p>The server requires rsync, an SSH client and Perl.  Again for
        Debian:</p>

        <pre class=example>apt-get install openssh-client rsync perl</pre>

        <p>For other platforms, you must consult their documentation,
        or install them from source:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">http://rsync.samba.org/</a>
          <li><A href="http://www.openssh.com/">http://www.openssh.com/</a>
        </ul>

        <h4><a name=ssh>2.1.1 SSH Setup</a></h4>

        <p>The server’s root login needs to be able to SSH to each of the
        clients’ root logins without having to enter a password or confirm
        a key hash.  You should consult the SSH documentation to set
        this up, but the general procedure, assuming you use RSA keys and
        OpenSSH, is as follows.  If you are sufficiently familiar with
        SSH to do this without further documentation, <a
        href="#config">skip to the next section</a>.</p>

        <p>On the server create an SSH key with:</p>

        <pre class=example>sudo ssh-keygen</pre>

        <p>When asked for a passphrase, just hit return (but see
        below).  Then copy <code>~root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> to each
        of the clients and append it to their
        <code>~root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.  At the same time,
        retrieve the clients’ host key hashes with:</p>

        <pre class=example>ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</pre>

        <p>As root on the server, <code>ssh</code> to each of the clients
        and verify their host keys hashes.</p>

        <h4><a name=installscript>2.1.2 Installing <code>rsbackup</code></a></h4>

        <p>To install <code>rsbackup</code>:</p>

        <pre class=example>wget http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2010/rsbackup-0.2.tar.gz
tar xf rsbackup-0.2.tar.gz
cd rsbackup-0.2
make
sudo make install</pre>

        <p>On Debian systems:</p>

        <pre class=example>wget http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2010/rsbackup_0.2_all.deb
dpkg -i rsbackup_0.2_all.deb</pre>

        <p>At this point it should be possible to read the man page, which
        contains reference information:</p>

        <pre class=example>man rsbackup</pre>

        <h4><a name=installvariations>2.1.3 Variations</a></h4>

        <h5>What If The Server Is Also A Client?</h5>

        <p>If you want to backup the backup server itself then you don’t
        need to set up the server to be able to SSH to itself.  See below
        for how to configure this.</p>

        <h5>What If I’m Not The Superuser?</h5>

        <p><code>rsbackup</code> does not actually depend on being the
        superuser, although of course its functionality will be limited if
        it isn’t.  However you could for instance use it to back up your
        home directory to your portable USB disk.  The setup is the same
        except that you do it for your personal login rather than root and
        therefore don’t use <code>sudo</code>.</p>

        <h5>What If I Don’t Like Empty Passphrases?</h5>

        <p>In this case you will have to find some other way of making the
        server’s private SSH key available when backups run.  This is
        outside the scope of this document.</p>

      </div>

      <h3><a name=config>2.2 Configuration</a></h3>

      <div>

        <p><code>rsbackup</code> reads a configuration file from
        <code>/etc/rsbackup/config</code>.  (Use the
        <code>--config</code> option to override this, if you prefer
        another location.)  You will need to enter some global
        settings and then describe the backup clients.</p>

        <h4><a name=store>2.2.1 Backup Storage</a></h4>

        <p>First you should define where backups will be stored.  This
        guide will assume you use removable hard disks, but you can use
        permanently online backups too.</p>

        <p>For each distinct backup device you need to define two
        things.  The first is the mount point that the device will
        appear at.  For example, if you have two backup disks and the
        mount points are <code>/mnt/backup1</code>
        and <code>/mnt/backup2</code> you would write the following:</p>

        <pre class=example>store /mnt/backup1
store /mnt/backup2</pre>

        <p>The second is to define device names.  Device names
        correspond to the contents of a single-line file
        called <code>device-id</code> in the root of the backup device.
        For instance, if you called your devices <code>backup1</code>
          and <code>backup2</code> you would write the following:</p>

        <pre class=example>device backup1
device backup2</pre>

        <p>Of course, you must also create these files!  For example:</p>

        <pre class=example>echo backup1 > /mnt/backup1/device-id
echo backup2 > /mnt/backup2/device-id</pre>

        <p><code>rsbackup</code> does not mind if the devices share a
        mount point (and only one is present at a time); any device
        may use any mount point as far as it’s concerned.  You will
        probably find it more convenient to give them separate mount
        points though.  If more than one device is mounted when you
        make a backup, backups will be made to <i>all</i> of them.
        You can use the <code>--store</code> option to select just
        one.</p>

        <p>Although it would of course be convenient for users to be able
        to access backups of their files directly, it would also mean
        that they could go “back in time” past permission changes or
        deletions of private files belonging to one another.
        Therefore, the top directory of your backup devices should
        (usually) be owned by root and mode 0700
        (i.e. <code>-rwx------</code>).
        By default, <code>rsbackup</code> will insist on this,
        although you can use the <code>public</code> option to change
        this behavior.</p>

        <pre class=example>chmod 700 /mnt/backup1 /mnt/backup2</pre>

        <p>Remember to update <code>/etc/updatedb.conf</code> to
        exclude your backup devices.  Otherwise <code>updatedb</code>
        will spend ever-increasing amounts of time indexing your
        backups.</p>

        <h4><a name=globals>2.2.2 Global Parameters</a></h4>

        <p>Next you may want to define some global ageing
        parameters.  These can be overridden for each volume you back
        up, so by defining global ones you are only setting
        defaults.</p>

        <p>The first one you might want to set is the maximum age of the
        most recent backup.  If any volume’s most recent backup is older
        than this many days then it will show up as red in the backup
        status report.  The default is 3 days.  To reduce it to (for
        instance) 1 day:</p>

        <pre class=example>max-age 1</pre>

        <p>The second parameter to choose is the age at which backups are
        automatically <i>pruned</i>, i.e. deleted.  The default is 366
        days, ensuring that you will be able to “go back” up to a year.
        If you only wanted to go back a month you could reduce it as
        follows:</p>

        <pre class=example>prune-age 31</pre>

        <p>Remember, these are defaults and can be overridden on a
        per-host or per-volume basis.</p>

        <p>There are a few other global settings described in the man
        page.  They will not be covered here.</p>

        <h4><a name=volumes>2.2.3 Defining What To Back Up</a></h4>

        <p>The rest of the configuration file will define what to back
        up (and what to exclude).</p>

        <p>There are two ways to organise your configuration file.
        First, you can put all the definitions in a single file.
        Alternatively, you can put each host’s definitions in a file
        of its own and include them.  See <a href="rsbackup-debian.html">the
        Debian-specific instructions</a> for an example of this.</p>

        <p>For each host to back up, you should write a <i>host
        stanza</i>.  This will contain some host level settings and then
        a <i>volume stanza</i> for each part of the host’s filesystem
        back up.</p>

        <p>Here is an example host stanza:</p>

        <pre class=example>host sfere
  volume root /
  volume boot /boot
  volume home /home
    prune-age 366
    exclude /*/Desktop/Trash/*
    exclude /*/.local/share/Trash/*
    exclude /*/.mozilla/*/Cache/*
    exclude /*/.ccache
  volume var /var
    exclude /tmp/*</pre>

        <p>The meaning of this is as follows:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><p>The first line contains the name of the host.  This would
          normally be its DNS name (see below for an example of where it
          is not).</p></li>

          <li><p>Each of the <code>volume</code> lines contains the name of
          a <i>volume</i> on the host and the path to that volume.  By
          default, <code>rsbackup</code> will assume that each volume
          corresponds to a (mounted) filesystem and therefore not backup
          files from other filesystems.</p></li>

          <li><p>In this case there are four volumes.  <code>root</code>
          and <code>boot</code> are quite simple: all the files in them
          will be backed up.</p></li>

          <li>
            <p><code>home</code>, however, is more complex.  Firstly, it
            has a <code>prune-age</code> setting to ensure that it is kept
            for longer than the default lifetime.  Secondly, it excludes
            various trash and cache directories.</p>

            <p>In the first three cases, it does this by backing up the
            directory but not its contents; they will be empty on the backup
            device.  In the fourth case, it does not even backup the
            directory.  Note that the exclusion patterns are rooted at the
            path to the volume - they are <i>not</i> absolute path names.
            (Consult the rsync documentation for <code>--exclude</code> for
            more information about these patterns.) </p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p><code>/var</code> is similar to <code>home</code> in that
            a temporary directory is excluded.</p>
          </li>

        </ul>

        <p><u>An important note</u>: the indentation is <i>not</i>
        significant to <code>rsbackup</code> - only to the reader.
        Anything that comes after a <code>host</code> directive and
        before the next <code>host</code> or <code>volume</code>
        directive is considered part of that host.  Similarly anything
        that comes after a <code>volume</code> directive and before the
        next <code>host</code> or <code>volume</code> directive is
        considered part of that volume.</p>

        <p>This example shows how to back up a host where the name
        differs from the DNS name.  The important part is the
        <code>hostname</code> directive:</p>

        <pre class=example>host lith
  <v>hostname chymax</v>
  volume lith /Volumes/Lith
    exclude "Temporary Internet Files"
    exclude /RECYCLER
    exclude /pagefile.sys
    exclude "/Documents and Settings/*/Local Settings/Temp"
    exclude "/System Volume Information/_restore*"</pre>

        <p>What is actually going on here is that <code>lith</code> is
        really the Windows partition on <code>chymax</code>.  The
        computer usually runs Unix, with the Windows partition mounted
        for convenience.  So to get <code>lith</code>’s files, it is
        necessary to ssh to <code>chymax</code>.</p>

        <p>This example shows how to back up without using SSH at all:</p>

        <pre class=example>host araminta
  <b>hostname localhost</b>
  volume root /
  volume boot /boot
  volume home /home
    prune-age 366
    exclude /*/Desktop/Trash/*
    exclude /*/.local/share/Trash/*
    exclude /*/.mozilla/*/Cache/*
    exclude /*/.ccache
  volume var /var
    exclude /tmp/*
  volume news /var/spool/news
    prune-age 14</pre>

        <p>In this case, <code>araminta</code> is actually the backup
        server, so using SSH would mean SSHing to itself.  The hostname
        <code>localhost</code> is special-cased to avoid using SSH at all.</p>

        <p>Here is example of backing up a laptop:</p>

        <pre class=example>host kakajou
  <b>max-age 7</b>
  volume users /Users
    prune-age 366
    exclude /*/.Trash/*
    exclude /*/Library/Caches
    exclude /*/Library/VirtualBox/Machines/*/Snapshots
    exclude /*/Library/VirtualBox/**.vdi
  volume local /local
    prune-age 366
  volume etc /etc
  volume sw /sw</pre>

        <p>This host is usually asleep or not even in the house, so
        opportunities to back it up are rare.  Therefore it has a
        host-wide <code>max-age</code> setting.</p>

      </div>

    </div>

    <h2><a name=byhand>3. Manual Backups</a></h2>

    <div>

      <h3><a name=initial>3.1 Initial Backup</a></h3>

      <div>

      <p>Before you actually make a backup, you should do a “dry run”
        to verify that <code>rsbackup</code> does what you expect.</p>

      <pre class=example>rsbackup --backup --dry-run</pre>

      <p>This will print out the commands that it <i>would</i> run
        without actually executing them.  It’s also a good way of
        verifying that the syntax of the configuration is correct.</p>

      <p>Once you’re happy with the output, you can try making an
        initial backup:</p>

      <pre class=example>rsbackup --backup --verbose</pre>

      <p>The <code>--verbose</code> option makes <code>rsbackup</code>
      report what it is doing as it progresses.  In normal use you
      would omit it but it’s useful when setting up and crucial when
      debugging.</p>

      <p>Depending on how much data you have (and how fast your disks
      and network are) the initial backup may take a very long time.
      I did my initial backups inside an instance
      of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a> so
      that they couldn’t be affected by logging out, etc.</p>

      <p>For each backup of each volume, a file will be created in
      <code>/var/log/backup</code> detailing the command executed and
      any error output.</p>

      </div>

      <h3><a name=prune>3.2 Pruning Old Backups</a></h3>

      <div>

      <p>Pruning refers to deleting a volume’s old backups.  During
      pruning, a backup will be deleted if it is older than the
      volume’s <code>max-age</code> setting, with the proviso that the
      most recent <code>min-backups</code> backups on each store will
      not be deleted.</p>

      <p>To prune any backups that are due to be deleted:</p>

      <pre class=example>rsbackup --prune --verbose</pre>

      <p>The details of what is pruned are logged to files
      in <code>/var/log/backup</code>.</p>

      </div>

      <h3><a name=incomplete>3.3 Failed Backups</a></h3>

      <div>

      <p>If a backup fails then it will be left in an incomplete
      state.  You can tell <code>rsbackup</code> to pick up where it
      left off simply by running it again on the same day; if however
      you leave it until another day then that backup will never be
      completed.  To delete any incomplete backups, therefore:</p>

      <pre class=example>rsbackup --prune-incomplete --verbose</pre>

        <p>Backups are not pruned <i>immediately</i> because even if
        they are incomplete, the portion that succeeded may be useful
        to reduce the amount of data copied when you retry.</p>

      </div>

      <h3><a name=retire>3.4 Retired Volumes</a></h3>

      <div>

        <p>When you take a volume or host out of service, you need to
        tell <code>rsbackup</code> about this.  The first part of this
        is to remove the corresponding <code>volume</code> or
        <code>host</code> sections in the configuration file.  If you
        don’t do this then <code>rsbackup</code> will keep on trying
        to backup the obsolete volume or host.</p>

        <p>The second part is to delete old backups for the volume and
        their corresponding logfiles.  If you don’t do this then the
        report will complain about them.  This can be done with the
        <code>--retire</code> option:</p>

        <pre class=example>rsbackup --retire <i>HOST</i>:<i>VOLUME</i></pre>

        <p>...or:

        <pre class=example>rsbackup --retire <i>HOST</i></pre>

        <p>All backups on available devices and their corresponding
        logfiles will be deleted (possibly a slow process).</p>

        <p>If you want to keep (say) the last backup for the volume
        then you should at least rename it aside, otherwise
        <code>--retire</code> will delete it; you may prefer to tar it
        up and compress it.</p>

      </div>

      <h3><a name=reports>3.5 Status Reports</a></h3>

      <div>

      <p>You can generate an HTML status report to a disk file:</p>

      <pre class=example>rsbackup --html status.html</pre>

      <p>This will show:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Any backups to unknown devices.  (See below.)</li>

        <li>For each volume, the dates of the oldest backup, how many
        backups exist.  The latter is red if there are any devices
        with <i>no</i> backups of the volume.</li>

        <li>For each volume’s backup to a each device, the date of the
        newest backup on the device and the total number of backups on
        the device.  The former is red if it violates the
        <code>max-age</code> setting for the volume and the latter is
        red if there are no backups of the volume on the device.</li>

        <li>Logfiles for any failed backups.</li>

        <li>Logfiles for pruning.</li>

      </ul>

        <p>You can also request that the report by sent by email, with
        the <code>--email</code> option.  This is intended for when
        automating backups.</p>

      </div>

      <p>If you installed from a <code>.deb</code> then have a look at
      the <a href="rsbackup-debian.html">Debian-specific documentation</a>.</p>

      <p>Manual backups might be perfectly adequate for you.  However,
      computers are often better at remembering to perform scheduled
      tasks than humans are, so it may be better to run your backups
      as a cron job.  For example, to run your backups, with pruning
      and a report, at 1am every day you might use the following
      crontab line:</p>

      <pre class=example>0 1 * * * rsbackup --backup --prune --email root</pre>

      <p>This will automatically do a backup every night, prune any
      out-of-date backups, and mail a report to the system
      administrator.</p>

      <p>You might want to add (for example) a weekly prune of
      incomplete backups:</p>

      <pre class=example>0 8 * * 0 rsbackup --prune-incomplete</pre>

    </div>

    <h2><a name=devices>5. Device Management</a></h2>

    <div>

      <h3><a name=lostdevice>5.1 Lost Devices</a></h3>

      <div>

        <p>Hard disks get lost or stolen, and fail.  In this
        case <code>rsbackup</code> needs to be told that one of its
        devices has gone away.  The first part of this is to delete the
        corresponding <code>device</code> directive in the configuration
        file (and the <code>store</code> directive, if that’s unique to
        the device).</p>

        <p>The second part is to delete logfiles for backups to the
        device.  If you don’t do this then the report will complain
        about them.  This can be done with the
        <code>--retire-device</code> option:</p>

        <pre class=example>rsbackup --retire-device <i>NAME</i></pre>

        <p>You can do these steps in either order, but if you delete
        the logfiles first, you will be ask if you are sure.  You can
        override this with the <code>--force</code> option.</p>

        <p><code>--retire-device</code> will never delete actual
        backups, only logfiles.</p>

      </div>

      <h3><a name=upgradedevice>5.2 Upgrading Devices</a></h3>

      <div>

        <p>If a backup device gets full you have several options:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><p>Reduce the number of backups to be kept on it by
          lowering <code>prune-age</code>.  But sooner or later you
          may reach the point where you just cannot keep backups as
          long as you like.</p></li>

          <li><p>Introduce an entirely new, bigger device and take the
          old device out of service, either keeping it against a rainy
          day or destroying it as described above.</p></li>

          <li><p>Copy all its contents to a new, bigger device,
          keeping the same device name.  Remember to delete the old
          <code>device-id</code> file, or confusion may
          follow!</p></li>

        </ul>

      </div>

    </div>

    <h2><a name=restore>6. Restoring</a></h2>

    <div>

      <p>Backups aren’t worth anything if you can’t restore, course.</p>

      <h3><a name=manualrestore>6.1 Manual Restoration</a></h3>

      <div>

        <p>The backup has the same layout, permissions etc as the
        original system, so it’s perfectly possible to simply copy
        files from a backup directory to their proper location.  This
        is the most convenient way if you want to rescue only a small
        number of files.</p>

        <p>Be careful to get file ownership right.  The backup is
        stored with the same numeric user and group ID as the original
        system used.</p>

        <p>Until a backup is completed, a corresponding
        <code>.incomplete</code> file will exist.  Check for such a
        file before restoring any given backup.</p>

      </div>

      <h3><a name=rsyncrestore>6.2 Restoring With <code>rsync</code></a></h3>

      <div>

        <p>You can do bulk restores with <code>rsync</code>.  For
        example, supposing that host <code>chymax</code> has a volume
        called <code>users</code> in which user home directories are
        backed up, and user <code>rjk</code> wants their entire home
        directory to be restored:</p>

        <pre class=example>rsync -aSHz --numeric-ids /store/chymax/users/2010-04-01/rjk/. chymax:~rjk/.</pre>

        <p><code>-a</code> means recursive into directories; preserve
        symlinks, permissions, modification times, groups, owners,
        device files and special files.  <code>-S</code> means handle
        sparse files efficiently.  <code>-H</code> means preserve hard
        links.  <code>-z</code> means compress data for transfer; you
        might want to omit this if your CPU is slow.</p>

        <p><code>--numeric-ids</code> is important as backups are
        stored with the same numeric user and group IDs as the
        original system; no translation via name is performed.</p>
