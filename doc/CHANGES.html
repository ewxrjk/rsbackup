    <h1>Changes To rsbackup</h1>

    <p>Please see <a
    href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup">rsbackup
    in git</a> for detailed change history.</p>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 6.0</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><b>Incompatible change</b>: the <code>min-backups</code> and
      <code>prune-age</code> directives have been removed. Instead,
      use <code>prune-parameter min-backups</code> and
      <code>prune-parameter prune-age</code>.</li>

      <li><b>Incompatible change</b>: the arguments to the
      <code>public</code>, <code>always-up</code> and
      <code>check-mounted</code> directives are now mandatory.</li>

      <li><b>Incompatible change</b>: the deprecated
      <code>colors</code> and directive <code>report-prune-logs</code>
      directives have been removed. Use <code>colors-good</code>,
      <code>colors-bad</code> and <code>report</code> instead.</li>

      <li>Concurrent backup of distinct hosts to distinct devices.
      See the <code>group</code> for fine-grained control and <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/18">issue
      #18</a> for discussion.</li>

      <li>More conservative CSS syntax is used, improving
      interoperability with AquaMail.
      Fixes <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/52">issue
      #52</a>.</li>

      <li>Line lengths in encoded images are bounded, improving
      interoperability with Exim.
      Fixes <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/53">issue
      #53</a>.</li>

      <li>Images in emails use attachments rather than
      inline <code>data:</code> URLs. This improves interoperability
      with GMail.
      Fixes <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/54">issue
      #54</a>.</li>

      <li>New <code>database</code> directive controls the database
      filename.  Fixes
      <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/55">issue
      #55</a>.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 5.1</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Store directories are now normally required to be mount
      points. See the description of <code>store</code>
      and <code>store-pattern</code>
      in <a href="rsbackup.5.html">rsbackup(5)</a>
      and <code>--unmounted-store</code> in <a
      href="rsbackup.1.html">rsbackup(1)</a> for options to
      restore the previous behavior.
      Fixes <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/42">issue
      #42</a>.</li>

      <li>Minor build fixes.</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 5.0</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><b>Incompatible change</b>: Configuration file parsing has
      changed slightly, with stricter rules about indentation. See <a
      href="rsbackup.5.html">rsbackup(5)</a> for details.</li>

      <li><b>Incompatible change</b>: The default location for
      snapshots has changed
      to <code>/var/lib/rsbackup/snapshots</code>. Fixes <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/28">issue
      #28</a>. <b>If you use snapshots you must adjust your
      configuration.</b></li>

      <li>New <code>host-check</code> directive controlling how to
        test whether hosts are up or
        down. Fixes <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/26">issue
        #26</a>.<br>

      <b>Advance warning</b>: the old <code>always-up</code> directive
      is now deprecated and will produce a warning.  In some future
      version it will be removed.</li>

      <li>ACLs and extended attributes are now backed up. Note that
      the options used assume a modern version of <code>rsync</code>,
      and are not supported by the version installed under macOS; also
      this feature can also cause some trouble with Windows filesystems. Set
      the <code>rsync-extra-options</code> as discussed
      in <a href="rsbackup.5.html">rsbackup(5)</a> to work around
      this.
      Fixes <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/37">issue
      #37</a> and <a
      #href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/41">issue
      #41</a>.</li>

      <li>The <code>--retire</code> option now always requests
      confirmation from the user.
      Fixes <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/38">issue
      #38</a>.</li>

      <li>New <code>--forget-only</code> option used
      with <code>--retire</code> to drop database records for backups
      without deleting the backups themselves.
      Fixes <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/41">issue
      #41</a>.</li>

      <li><code>pre-backup-hook</code> scripts may now exit with a
      distinct exit status to indicate a transient failure, equivalent
      to a <code>check-file</code> or <code>check-mounted</code> test
      failing.
      Addresses <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/43">issue
      #43</a>.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 4.0</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>A new tool, <code>rsbackup-graph</code>, has been
      introduced.  This generates a graphical representation of
      available backups.</li>

      <li>The <code>colors</code> directive is now split
      into <code>colors-good</code> and <code>colors-bad</code> which
      can take either RGB or HSV parameters.<br>

      <b>Advance warning</b>: the old <code>colors</code> directive
      is now deprecated and will produce a warning.  In some future
      version it will be removed.</li>

      <li>Report contents can now be parameterized using the new
      <code>report</code> directive.<br>

      <b>Advance warning</b>: the old <code>report-prune-logs</code>
      directive is now deprecated and will produce a warning.  In some
      future version it will be removed.</li>

      <li>Configuration file documentation has been moved to a new man
      page, <a href="rsbackup.5.html">rsbackup(5)</a>.</li>

      <li>Various minor bugs have been fixed.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 3.1</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Don’t throw exceptions from destructors.  Addresses <a
      href="https://bugs.debian.org/811705">Debian bug
      #811705</a>.</li>

      <li>Fix error handling in character encoding translation.</li>

      <li>Patch from Maria Valentina Marin to use consistent mtimes
      during <code>.deb</code> build.  Fixes <a
      href="https://bugs.debian.org/793716">Debian bug
      #793716</a>.</li>

      <li>Stop cron scripts exiting nonzero if <code>.deb</code> is
      removed.  Fixes <a
      href="https://bugs.debian.org/810335">Debian bug
      #810335</a>.</li>

      <li>Patch from Jonathon Wiltshire to use <code>install</code>
      rather than <code>cp</code> during <code>.deb</code>
      builds.</li>

      <li>Correct distribution of scripts.</li>

      <li>Add missing <code>.deb</code> build dependencies.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 3.0</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Pruning now supports selectable, and pluggable, pruning
      policies.  See the <code>PRUNING</code> section of the man page
      for further information.  The default behavior matches previous
      versions.
      <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/7">Fixes
      issue #7</a>.<br>

      <b>Advance warning</b>: the <code>min-backups</code>
      and <code>prune-age</code> directives are now deprecated in
      their current form and will produce a warning.  In some future
      version they will be removed.  Instead,
      use <code>prune-parameter min-backups</code>
      and <code>prune-parameter prune-age</code>.</li>

      <li><b>Advance warning</b>: the <code>public</code>,
      <code>always-up</code>, <code>check-mounted</code> and
      <code>traverse</code> directives now take an explicit boolean
      argument.  Using them without an argument is now deprecated (but
      has not changed in meaning).  In some future version the
      argument will become mandatory.</li>

      <li>Removal of backups (when pruning, or retiring a volume) now
      parallelizes removal across devices. <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/24">Fixes issue
      #24</a>.</li>

      <li>The <code>rsync-timeout</code> and <code>hook-timeout</code>
      directives are now inherited, as documented.
      <code>ssh-timeout</code> becomes inherited too.  The
      <code>sendmail</code> directive is now documented.</li>

      <li>Host and volume names may no longer start with
      &ldquo;<code>-</code>&rdquo;.</li>

      <li><code>--dump-config --verbose</code> now annotates its
      output.  Some options missed by <code>--dump-config</code> are
      now output.</li>

      <li>A C++11 compiler and Boost are now required.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 2.1</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><code>rsbackup.cron</code> will always run the prune and
      report steps, even if the earlier steps fail.</li>

      <li><code>rsbackup-snapshot-hook</code> copes better with
      aliases for logical volumes.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/23">Fixes issue
      #23</a>.</li>

      <li>Pruning logs in the report are now limited by the
      <code>report-prune-logs</code> configuration setting.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 2.0</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><b>Incompatible change</b>: pre-backup and post-backup hooks
      are now run even in <code>--dry-run</code> mode.  The
      environment variables <code>RSBACKUP_ACT</code> can be used by
      the script to distinguish the two situations.
      <code>rsbackup-snapshot-hook</code> has been modified
      accordingly.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/9">Fixes issue
      #9</a>.</li>

      <li><b>Incompatible change</b>: The log format has changed.
      The old per-backup logfiles are gone, replaced by a SQLite
      database.  Old installations are automatically upgraded.
      <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/11">Fixes
      issue #11</a>.</li>

      <li>New <code>check-mounted</code> option verifies that a volume
      is mounted before backing it up.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/13">Fixes issue
      #13</a>.</li>

      <li>New <code>store-pattern</code> option allows stores to be
      specified by a glob pattern instead of individually.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/5">Fixes issue
      #5</a>.</li>

      <li>New <code>stylesheet</code> and <code>colors</code> options
      allow operator control of the stylesheet and coloration in the
      HTML version of the report.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/6">Fixes issue
      #6</a>.</li>

      <li>The semantics of <code>lock</code> are now documented.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/20">Fixes issue
      #20</a>.</li>

      <li>Shell scripts supplied with <code>rsbackup</code> no longer
      depend on Bash.</li>

      <li>Dashes are now allowed in hostnames.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/21">Fixes issue
      #21</a>.</li>

      <li>The order in which hosts are backed up can now be controlled
      with the <code>priority</code> option.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/19">Fixes issue
      #19</a>.</li>

      <li>Reports now include counts of various error/warning
      conditions in the summary section; email reports reflect these
      in the subject line.  The <code>always-up</code> option is
      slightly modified: backups of always-up hosts are attempted,
      resulting in error logs, even if they do not seem to be
      available.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/22">Fixes issue
      #22</a>.</li>

      <li>New <code>--database</code> option allows the path to the
      database to be overridden.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 1.2</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Quoting and completeness fixes to <code>--dump-config</code>
      option.</li>

      <li>OSX builds work again.</li>

      <li>The cron scripts no longer attempt to run
      <code>rsbackup.cron</code> when it has been removed.  Fixes <A
      href="https://bugs.debian.org/766455">Debian bug
      #766455</a>.</li>

      <li>Some fixes to Debian packaging.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 1.1</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Error messages about missing unavailable devices with
      <code>--store</code> are now more accurate.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/10">Fixes issue
      #10</a>.</li>

      <li>The <code>include</code> command now skips filenames that
      start with <code>#</code>.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/12">Fixes issue
      #12</a>.</li>

      <li>The command-line parser now rejects invalid host and volume
      names (rather than accepting ones that will never match
      anything).  Zero-length device, host and volume names are now
      rejected (in all contexts).</li>

      <li>The test suite has been expanded, and supports concurrent
      execution if a sufficiently recent version of Automake is used.
      <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/14">Fixes
      issue #14</a>.</li>

      <li><code>rsbackup-snapshot-hook</code> no longer fails if
      <code>fsck</code> finds and fixes errors.  It is also now
      tested.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/15">Fixes issue
      #15</a>.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 1.0</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>New <code>--dump-config</code> option to verify
      configuration file parse.</li>

      <li>New <code>--check</code> option to
      <code>rsbackup-mount</code>.</li>

      <li>Configuration files are now read in a fixed order (<a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/8">issue
      #8</a>).</li>

      <li>The <code>--force</code> option no longer implies the
      <code>--verbose</code> option.  (This was a bug.)</li>

      <li>Minor bug fixes.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.4.4</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Correct <code>RSBACKUP_STATUS</code> value passed to
      post-backup hook.  (Bug spotted by Jacob Nevins.)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.4.2</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><code>--retire</code> no longer fails if a host directory
      has already been removed.</li>

      <li>Fixed recalculation of per-device backup counts, visible as
      self-inconsistent reports when generated in the same invocation
      of <code>rsbackup</code> as some other operation.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.4.1</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Fix a crash with the <code>--html</code> option (Jon Amery).</li>

      <li>Fix to <code>--prune-incomplete</code> option, which
      wouldn't work in the absence of some other option (Jacob
      Nevins).</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.4</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>The new <code>pre-access-hook</code> and
      <code>post-access-hook</code> options support running “hook”
      scripts before and after any access to backup storage
      devices.</li>

      <li>The new <code>pre-backup-hook</code> and
      <code>post-backup-hook</code> options support running “hook”
      scripts before and after a backup.  Although these can be used
      for any purpose, the motivation is to enable the creation of LVM
      snapshots of the subject filesystems (and their destruction
      afterwards), resulting in more consistent backups.  The supplied
      hook script only knows about the Linux logical volume
      system.</li>

      <li>The new <code>devices</code> option allows a host or volume
      to be restricted to a subset of devices, identified by a
      filename glob pattern.</li>

      <li>The new <code>rsync-timeout</code> option allows a time
      limit to be imposed on a backup.</li>

      <li>The new <code>check-file</code> option allows backups of a
      volume to be suppressed when it is not available (for instance,
      because it is only sometimes mounted).</li>

      <li><code>--verbose</code> (and therefore
      <code>--dry-run</code>) is now more verbose.</li>

      <li><code>--text</code> and <code>--html</code> now accept
      <code>-</code> to write to standard output.</li>

      <li>Improved error reporting.</li>

      <li>Minor bug fixes and portability and build script improvements.</li>

      <li><code>rsbackup-mount</code> now supports unencrypted devices
      and separate key material files (contributed by Matthew
      Vernon).</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.3</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><code>--prune</code> honours command-line selections again.</li>

      <li>The “oldest” backup for a host with no backups now shows up
      as “none” rather than “1980-01-01”.</li>

      <li>The new <code>--logs</code> option controls which logfiles
      are included in the HTML report.  The default is to only include
      the logfile of the most recent backup if it failed.  Also, if
      the most recent attempt to backup a volume to a given device
      failed, its heading is highlighted (in red).</li>

      <li>The tool scripts now have proper <code>--version</code>
      options.  Single-letter command line options are now supported
      (in fact they existed in many cases already but weren’t
      documented).</li>

      <li>Retiring a volume no longer makes a (futile and harmless!)
      attempt to remove <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>.</li>

      <li>The <code>.incomplete</code> files used by the Perl script
      to indicate partial backups are now created by the C++ version
      too.  They are created both before starting a backup and before
      pruning it.  rsbackup itself does not rely on them itself but
      they are an important hint to the operator when doing bulk
      restores.</li>

      <li>Logfiles of backups where pruning has commenced are now
      updated to reflect this, so that they will not be counted as
      viable backups in the report.</li>

      <li>Error output from failed backups is now more visible.  The
      old behaviour can be restored with the <tt>--no-errors</tt>
      option.</li>

      <li>Missing or misconfigured stores are now reported in more
      detail.  If it looks like a store is present but misconfigured
      (for instance, wrong permissions), this is always reported as an
      error.  If it looks like the store is absent then this is only
      reported if <code>--warn-store</code> is given, but if <i>no</i>
      configured store is present then the problems found with all
      configured stores are listed.  The documentation on how to set
      up stores has also been clarified.</li>

      <li>Prune logs now include detail about why a backup was
      eligible for pruning.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.2</h2>

    <p><code>rsbackup</code> has been rewritten in C++.  The behaviour
    is largely same except as follows:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>New <code>--text</code> option generates a plaintext version
      of the report.  In addition the email report includes both the
      text and HTML versions.</li>

      <li><code>--prune-unknown</code> is removed.  It is replaced by
      <code>--retire</code>, which is used to remove backups of
      volumes (and hosts) that are no longer in use and
      <code>--retire-device</code> which is used to remove logs for
      devices that are no longer in use.</li>

      <li>The <code>rsync</code> command now includes the
      <code>--delete</code> option, meaning that interrupted backups
      no longer include stray files from the first attempt.</li>

      <li><code>.incomplete</code> files are no longer created.
      Instead the logs are used to distinguish complete from
      incomplete backups.</li>

      <li>Various <code>--warn-</code> options to control what is
      warned about.</li>

      <li>New <code>always-up</code> option to indicate that a host is
      expected to always be available to back up.</li>

      <li>There are now test scripts.</li>

    </ul>
