    <h1>Changes To rsbackup</h1>

    <p>Please see <a
    href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup">rsbackup
    in git</a> for detailed change history.</p>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 1.1</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Error messages about missing unavailable devices with
      <code>--store</code> are now more accurate.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/10">Fixes issue
      #10</a>.</li>

      <li>The <code>include</code> command now skips filenames that
      start with <code>#</code>.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/12">Fixes issue
      #12</a>.</li>

      <li>The command-line parser now rejects invalid host and volume
      names (rather than accepting ones that will never match
      anything).  Zero-length device, host and volume names are now
      rejected (in all contexts).</li>

      <li>The test suite has been expanded, and supports concurrent
      execution if a sufficiently recent version of Automake is used.
      <a href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/14">Fixes
      issue #14</a>.</li>

      <li><code>rsbackup-snapshot-hook</code> no longer fails if
      <code>fsck</code> finds and fixes errors.  It is also now
      tested.  <a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/15">Fixes issue
      #15</a>.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 1.0</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>New <code>--dump-config</code> option to verify
      configuration file parse.</li>

      <li>New <code>--check</code> option to
      <code>rsbackup-mount</code>.</li>

      <li>Configuration files are now read in a fixed order (<a
      href="https://github.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup/issues/8">issue
      #8</a>).</li>

      <li>The <code>--force</code> option no longer implies the
      <code>--verbose</code> option.  (This was a bug.)</li>

      <li>Minor bug fixes.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.4.4</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Correct <code>RSBACKUP_STATUS</code> value passed to
      post-backup hook.  (Bug spotted by Jacob Nevins.)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.4.2</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><code>--retire</code> no longer fails if a host directory
      has already been removed.</li>

      <li>Fixed recalculation of per-device backup counts, visible as
      self-inconsistent reports when generated in the same invocation
      of <code>rsbackup</code> as some other operation.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.4.1</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Fix a crash with the <code>--html</code> option (Jon Amery).</li>

      <li>Fix to <code>--prune-incomplete</code> option, which
      wouldn't work in the absence of some other option (Jacob
      Nevins).</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.4</h2>
    
    <ul>

      <li>The new <code>pre-access-hook</code> and
      <code>post-access-hook</code> options support running “hook”
      scripts before and after any access to backup storage
      devices.</li>

      <li>The new <code>pre-backup-hook</code> and
      <code>post-backup-hook</code> options support running “hook”
      scripts before and after a backup.  Although these can be used
      for any purpose, the motivation is to enable the creation of LVM
      snapshots of the subject filesystems (and their destruction
      afterwards), resulting in more consistent backups.  The supplied
      hook script only knows about the Linux logical volume
      system.</li>

      <li>The new <code>devices</code> option allows a host or volume
      to be restricted to a subset of devices, identified by a
      filename glob pattern.</li>

      <li>The new <code>rsync-timeout</code> option allows a time
      limit to be imposed on a backup.</li>

      <li>The new <code>check-file</code> option allows backups of a
      volume to be suppressed when it is not available (for instance,
      because it is only sometimes mounted).</li>

      <li><code>--verbose</code> (and therefore
      <code>--dry-run</code>) is now more verbose.</li>

      <li><code>--text</code> and <code>--html</code> now accept
      <code>-</code> to write to standard output.</li>

      <li>Improved error reporting.</li>

      <li>Minor bug fixes and portability and build script improvements.</li>

      <li><code>rsbackup-mount</code> now supports unencrypted devices
      and separate key material files (contributed by Matthew
      Vernon).</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.3</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><code>--prune</code> honours command-line selections again.</li>

      <li>The “oldest” backup for a host with no backups now shows up
      as “none” rather than “1980-01-01”.</li>

      <li>The new <code>--logs</code> option controls which logfiles
      are included in the HTML report.  The default is to only include
      the logfile of the most recent backup if it failed.  Also, if
      the most recent attempt to backup a volume to a given device
      failed, its heading is highlighted (in red).</li>

      <li>The tool scripts now have proper <code>--version</code>
      options.  Single-letter command line options are now supported
      (in fact they existed in many cases already but weren’t
      documented).</li>

      <li>Retiring a volume no longer makes a (futile and harmless!)
      attempt to remove <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>.</li>

      <li>The <code>.incomplete</code> files used by the Perl script
      to indicate partial backups are now created by the C++ version
      too.  They are created both before starting a backup and before
      pruning it.  rsbackup itself does not rely on them itself but
      they are an important hint to the operator when doing bulk
      restores.</li>

      <li>Logfiles of backups where pruning has commenced are now
      updated to reflect this, so that they will not be counted as
      viable backups in the report.</li>

      <li>Error output from failed backups is now more visible.  The
      old behaviour can be restored with the <tt>--no-errors</tt>
      option.</li>

      <li>Missing or misconfigured stores are now reported in more
      detail.  If it looks like a store is present but misconfigured
      (for instance, wrong permissions), this is always reported as an
      error.  If it looks like the store is absent then this is only
      reported if <code>--warn-store</code> is given, but if <i>no</i>
      configured store is present then the problems found with all
      configured stores are listed.  The documentation on how to set
      up stores has also been clarified.</li>

      <li>Prune logs now include detail about why a backup was
      eligible for pruning.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.2</h2>

    <p><code>rsbackup</code> has been rewritten in C++.  The behaviour
    is largely same except as follows:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>New <code>--text</code> option generates a plaintext version
      of the report.  In addition the email report includes both the
      text and HTML versions.</li>

      <li><code>--prune-unknown</code> is removed.  It is replaced by
      <code>--retire</code>, which is used to remove backups of
      volumes (and hosts) that are no longer in use and
      <code>--retire-device</code> which is used to remove logs for
      devices that are no longer in use.</li>

      <li>The <code>rsync</code> command now includes the
      <code>--delete</code> option, meaning that interrupted backups
      no longer include stray files from the first attempt.</li>

      <li><code>.incomplete</code> files are no longer created.
      Instead the logs are used to distinguish complete from
      incomplete backups.</li>

      <li>Various <code>--warn-</code> options to control what is
      warned about.</li>

      <li>New <code>always-up</code> option to indicate that a host is
      expected to always be available to back up.</li>

      <li>There are now test scripts.</li>

    </ul>
