    <h1>Setting Up An Encrypted Disk</h1>

    <p>This isn’t part of <code>rsbackup</code> proper, but since you
    might well want to encrypt your backups, the setup process is
    sketched here.</p>

    <h2>Threat Model</h2>

    <div>

      <p>The main threat I’m interested in protecting against is that
      a petty criminal comes into possession of my backup disk either
      by stealing it from an offsite location, or because I manage to
      lose it somehow.  I don’t want them able to read my email or
      gain access to website passwords (of which I have far too many
      to remember, and most of them don’t protect anything especially
      important).</p>

      <p>I’m not especially interested in protecting my backups from
      the NSA.  If an organisation with government-level resources
      were to take an interest in me, then realistically they have
      better tools available than stealing my backups.</p>

      <p>The reason I document this is that, if you are interested in
      defending against better-resourced attacks than I am (for
      instance if you live in a country with a highly repressive
      government), the details below may <b>not</b> be suitable for
      you.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>The Tools</h2>

    <div>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_mapper">device
      mapper</a> is the Linux kernel’s framework for creating
      <i>virtual block devices</i>.  In this case, we are interested
      in creating a virtual block device that has the plain text
      corresponding to encrypted data on a physical block device.</p>

      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt">dm-crypt</a>
      is the low-level means of achieving this: writes to the virtual
      block device are encrypted and forwarded to the underlying
      physical device, and similarly reads from the virtual block
      devices are forwarded to the physical device and the content
      decrypted.  The plain text will not be available if the correct
      key has not been supplied.</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup">Linux
      Unified Key Setup</a> (LUKS) is a specific encryption scheme
      that we’ll use.</p>

      <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/">cryptsetup</a>
      is a command line tool we’ll use to set things up.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Setting Up An Encrypted Device</h2>

    <div>

      <p>First create the partition to encrypt, using your favourite
      disk partitioner, <code>lvcreate</code>, or whatever.  Any
      pre-existing contents will be destroyed, so take a backup if
      there is anything important there.  I’ll assume below that the
      device name for the partition it <code>/dev/sdb1</code>, but
      obviously you should change this to whatever device you are
      using.</p>

      <p>To create the LUKS data structures and establish a key:</p>

      <pre class=example># <b>cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1</b>

WARNING!
========
This will overwrite data on /dev/sdb1 irrevocably.

Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes): YES
Enter LUKS passphrase:
Verify passphrase:
Command successful.</pre>

      <p>As you can see, you must choose a passphrase.  The default
      encryption key is 128 bits long, so it’s worth using a longer
      password than the traditional 8 characters, provided you can
      actually remember it.  (A password you can’t remember is no use
      whatsoever.)</p>

      <p><b>Note</b>: <code>cryptsetup</code> also supports reading the key
      from a file.  If keeping the key file safe somewhere (a couple
      of well-hidden USB sticks, say) is easier than remembering a
      suitably long passphrase, that might be more appropriate.</p>

      <p><b>Note</b>: <code>cryptsetup</code> offers a variety of
      cipher specifications.  You may wish to review the available
      options and consult the <a
      href="https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions">cryptsetup
      FAQ</a> rather than accepting the default.</p>

      <p>At this point the encrypted partition exists but does not
      have any filesystem in it and the underlying plaintext is not
      accessible.  It’s possible to detect the format:</p>

      <pre class=example># <b>cat /dev/sdb1 | file -</b>
/dev/stdin: LUKS encrypted file, ver 1 [aes, cbc-essiv:sha256, sha1] UUID: c3ad50a5-a379-4e72-9f92-cacf592</pre>

      <p>The next step is to create a virtual block device with the
      plaintext:</p>

      <pre class=example># <b>cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 backup3</b>
Enter LUKS passphrase:
key slot 0 unlocked.
Command successful.
# <b>ls -l /dev/mapper/backup3</b>
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 254, 7 2010-03-14 15:54 /dev/mapper/backup3</pre>

      <p>You will need to re-enter the passphrase you chose earlier.</p>

      <p>At this point you can create a filesystem:

      <pre class=example># <b>mkfs -j -Lbackup3 /dev/mapper/backup3</b>
mke2fs 1.41.3 (12-Oct-2008)
Filesystem label=backup3
OS type: Linux
Block size=4096 (log=2)
Fragment size=4096 (log=2)
62336 inodes, 248870 blocks
12443 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user
First data block=0
Maximum filesystem blocks=255852544
8 block groups
32768 blocks per group, 32768 fragments per group
7792 inodes per group
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
        32768, 98304, 163840, 229376

Writing inode tables: done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done

This filesystem will be automatically checked every 29 mounts or
180 days, whichever comes first.  Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.</pre>

      <p>When I did this on a 4TB USB2-attached disk, it took about 40 minutes.
      So you might want to go away and do something else.</p>

      <p>By default the filesystem will be regularly fsck’d.  You can
      suppress this, if you want:</p>

      <pre class=example># <b>tune2fs -c0 -i0 /dev/mapper/backup3</b></pre>

      <p>It’s now possible to mount the new filesystem:

      <pre class=example># <b>mount /dev/mapper/backup3 /mnt</b>
# <b>really ls -l /mnt</b>
total 16
drwx------ 2 root root 16384 2010-03-14 15:55 lost+found
richard@araminta:~$ <b>df -h /mnt</b>
Filesystem             Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/backup3    957M  1.2M  908M   1% /mnt</pre>

      <p>So now you can create files, take backups, etc.</p>

      <p>Note that just because the disk is encrypted does <i>not</i>
      imply that other users of the system cannot get at its contents
      while it’s mounted.  The normal file permission rules apply.</p>

      <p>To unmount and detach the disk:</p>

      <pre class=example># <b>umount /mnt</b>
# <b>cryptsetup luksClose backup3</b></pre>
