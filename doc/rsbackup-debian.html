    <h1>rsbackup and Debian</h1>

    <p>The Debian package of <code>rsbackup</code> has some extra
    features.  You could use these on other systems but on Debian they
    are set up to work automatically.</p>

    <h2><code>/etc/rsbackup/config</code></h2>

    <p>In the <code>.deb</code> package, the default
    <code>/etc/rsbackup/config</code> is as follows:</p>

    <pre class=example># Location of lockfile
lock /var/run/rsbackup.lock

# User configuration
include /etc/rsbackup/local

# Hosts
include /etc/rsbackup/hosts.d</pre>

    <p>Normally you would not edit this file.  Instead, put local
    configuration in <code>/etc/rsbackup/local</code> and a file for
    each host to back up into <code>/etc/rsbackup/hosts.d</code>.</p>

    <h2><code>/etc/rsbackup/defaults</code></h2>

    <p>There is an extra configuration file for the cron jobs,
    <code>/etc/rsbackup/defaults</code>.  The default is as
    follows:</p>

    <pre class=example>#
# List hosts to backup hourly, daily, weekly and monthly
#  - set the empty string to back up no hosts (at that frequency)
#  - use the special string "_all" to back up everything
#
hourly=""
daily=_all
weekly=""
monthly=""

#
# Set report=hourly|daily|weekly|monthly to control frequency of
# email reports.  (Hourly is probably a bit much!)  Only effective
# if email is not "".
#
report=daily

#
# Set email=ADDRESS to have the report emailed to that address.
#
email=root

#
# Set prune=hourly|daily|weekly|monthly|never to control frequency of
# automated pruning of old backups
#
prune=daily

#
# Set prune_incomplete=hourly|daily|weekly|monthly|never to control
# frequency of automated pruning of incomplete backups
#
prune_incomplete=weekly

#
# Prefix to the rsbackup command
# Use 'nice' and/or 'ionice' here
#
nicely=</pre>

    <ul>

      <li>
        <p><code>hourly</code>, <code>daily</code>,
          <code>weekly</code> and <code>monthly</code> define the
          hosts to back up at the given frequencies.  You can set any
          (or all) of them to <code>_all</code> to back up all known
          hosts.</p>

        <p>Set them all to <code>""</code>if you have some other
          arrangement for initiating backups.</p>

        <p><code>hourly</code> is intended to be used to
          opportunistically back up hosts that are often down, for
          instance laptops and personal desktops.  <code>weekly</code>
          and <code>monthly</code> are appropriate for hosts that
          almost never change.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p>Set <code>email</code> to the destination address for
          reports from the daily backup run, or comment out the line
          entirely to suppress email reports.  If you want reports at
          some other frequency than daily, modify
          <code>report</code>.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p>Modify <code>prune</code> to control the frequency of
          pruning of old backups.  It is recommended to leave this as
          <code>daily</code>, since deleting a week or moreâ€™s worth of
          backups takes a very long time.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p>Modify <code>prune_incomplete</code> to control the
          frequency of deleting incomplete backups.  It is recommended
          to keep this at a lower frequency than you take backups, as
          otherwise <code>rsync</code> will not be able to use
          incomplete backups to optimize new ones.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p>Modify <code>nicely</code> to control the priority of
        <code>rsbackup</code>.  For example, you might use:</p>

        <pre>nicely="nice ionice -3"</pre>

      </li>

    </ul>
