rsbackup
========

rsbackup backs up your computer(s) to removable hard disks.  The
backup is an ordinary filesystem tree, and hard links between repeated
backups are used to save space.  Old backups are automatically pruned
after a set period of time.

Installation
------------

You will need [rsync](http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/).

On Debian/Ubuntu systems,
[get rsbackup.deb](http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/rsbackup) and
install that.

On other systems:

    ./autogen.sh # only if you got it from git
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Documentation
