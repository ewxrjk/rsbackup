/** @brief Indentation tracker
 *
 * The @e indent @e depth of a line is the number of spaces at the start. (The
 * caller will convert tabs in the usual way but that is out of scope for this
 * class.)
 *
 * The @e level of a line is an integer with a single bit set representing its
 * logical depth. Within a single block at a given level, the indent depth must
 * be consistent.
 *
 * The caller is expected to figure out the acceptable levels of a line based
 * on its content (and perhaps the current level), and call @ref Indent::check
 * to identify which actual level to select.
 *
 * For a line that introduces a new, more deeply-indented, section, it should
 * also call @ref Indent::introduce, to indicate the new level. This must be
 * greater than the level returned by @ref Indent::check.
