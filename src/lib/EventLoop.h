 * @brief Asynchronous operations
 *
 * To manage asynchronous operations:
 * - create a single @ref EventLoop object
 * - create file descriptors and subprocesses
 * - create @ref Reactor objects to handle I/O, timeouts and subprocesses
 * - attach the reactor objects to the event loop
 * - use @ref EventLoop::wait to start processing events
 *
 * Note that the event loop should be created before any subprocesses are
 * created; otherwise the signal handling will not work properly.
