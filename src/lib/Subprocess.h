/** @brief Subprocess execution
 *
 * This class supports three modes of operation.
 *
 * 1. Standalone synchronous execution.  The caller sets up the subprocess and
 * then invokes @ref Subprocess::runAndWait.  An internal @ref EventLoop is
 * used.  In this case it is possible to capture output to strings with @ref
 * Subprocess::capture but not to manage pipes directly since the caller has no
 * opportunity to read or write them.  Only one subprocess may exist at a time.
 *
 * 2. Standalone asynchronous execution.  The caller sets up the subprocess and
 * then invokes @ref Subprocess::run.  Later the caller invokes @ref
 * Subprocess::wait.  As above, an internal @ref EventLoop is used.  In this
 * case it is possible to manage pipes directly with @ref
 * Subprocess::addChildFD.  Captures will work with small outputs but since the
 * event loop only has an opportunity to read or write the capture pipes when
 * @c wait() is called, they do not work in general.  Only one subprocess may
 * exist at a time.
 *
 * 3. Concurrent execution as part of an @ref ActionList.  The caller sets up
 * many subprocesses and adds them to the action list with @ref
 * ActionList::add, before starting them and waiting for them with @ref
 * ActionList::go.  When the action list is complete, wait statuses may be
 * retrieved with @ref Subprocess::getStatus.  String captures will work and if
 * the caller registers reactors with the event loop then pipes can also be
 * managed directly.
